full access to everything. Instead, you define:
Who can do something
What they can do
Where they can do it
That’s where Roles and RoleBindings come in.

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) :
================================
in Kubernetes is a method of regulating access to resources based on the roles
of individual users or service accounts within a cluster. It helps ensure that 
users or processes only have the permissions they need and nothing more

Subjects
=========
Subjects are entities you grant permissions to:
Users – authenticated human users
Groups – a collection of users
ServiceAccounts – accounts used by applications running in pods


1. Role
Defines a set of permissions (rules) within a namespace.
Specifies what actions can be taken on which resources.
Example: A Role might allow listing pods and creating ConfigMaps in a specific namespace.

2. ClusterRole
Similar to a Role but is cluster-scoped.
Can be used across all namespaces or for non-namespaced resources (e.g., nodes, persistent volumes).
Can also be used in namespaced contexts.

3. RoleBinding
Binds a Role to a user, group, or service account within a namespace.
Grants the permissions defined in the Role to the subject.

4. ClusterRoleBinding
Binds a ClusterRole to a user, group, or service account across the entire cluster.
Useful for giving global access.


command:
