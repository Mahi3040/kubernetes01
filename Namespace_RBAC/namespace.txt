1️⃣ What is a Namespace?

A namespace is a logical partition inside a Kubernetes cluster.

Think of it like a folder or project inside a cluster where you can organize resources (Pods, Deployments, Services, etc.).

Each namespace is isolated from others in terms of resource management and name collisions.

2️⃣ Why we use Namespaces
Organize resources

Example:

dev-team namespace → for development resources

prod-team namespace → for production resources

You can have the same Deployment name in different namespaces:

dev-team/namespace_deployment
prod-team/namespace_deployment


They won’t conflict.

Access control

You can apply Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) per namespace.

Example: Devs can only manage resources in dev-team namespace, not in prod-team.

Resource quotas

You can limit CPU, memory, or number of Pods per namespace using ResourceQuota.

Prevents one team from consuming all cluster resources.

Isolation

Network policies and service discovery can be scoped per namespace.

Helps avoid accidental interference between teams/environments.
