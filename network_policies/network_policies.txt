A NetworkPolicy in Kubernetes is a resource that controls network traffic between:

Pods → Pods
Pods → External endpoints
External endpoints → Pods

By default:

🔹 All pods in a cluster can talk to each other (no restrictions).
🔹 Once a NetworkPolicy is applied to a pod, all traffic is denied by default unless explicitly allowed.

So, NetworkPolicies define “who can talk to whom” and “on what ports/protocols.”
