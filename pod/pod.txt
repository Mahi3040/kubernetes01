APi Vaersion
===========
Purpose	Description	Example
1️⃣ Tell Kubernetes which version of a resource you are using.Each resource (Pod, Deployment, etc.) has a version. apiVersion tells the API server how to handle it.	apiVersion: apps/v1 for Deployment
2️⃣ Controls validation rules	Different versions support different fields/features. Using the right version ensures your YAML is valid.	apps/v1 requires selector in Deployment
3️⃣ Ensures compatibility with cluster version	Some apiVersions are deprecated or removed in new Kubernetes versions.	extensions/v1beta1 is no longer valid
4️⃣ Determines which controller handles the resource	The version helps Kubernetes route the resource to the correct internal controller.	Deployments go to the Deployment Controller
5️⃣ Used internally by Kubernetes API server	The server uses it to decode the YAML into correct Go structs.	e.g., core/v1.Pod, apps/v1.Deployment structs
6️⃣ Needed for CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions)	When creating your own resources, you define custom apiVersions like mygroup.example.com/v1	Custom APIs for operators, tools, etc.
