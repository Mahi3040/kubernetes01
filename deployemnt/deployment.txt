1️⃣ Control Plane Components

These components manage the overall cluster state.

Component	                         Purpose
API Server (kube-apiserver)   	Central hub of Kubernetes. All kubectl or API calls go here. Validates requests, enforces schema, runs admission controllers, and stores objects in etcd.
etcd                        	Distributed key-value store. Persists the cluster’s state (Pods, Deployments, ConfigMaps, etc.). Acts as Kubernetes’ source of truth.
Controller Manager (kube-controller-manager)	Runs various controllers that maintain desired state:
• Node Controller →  monitors nodes
• Deployment Controller → creates ReplicaSets for Deployments
• Replication Controller → ensures N replicas (pod creation)
• Job Controller → runs batch jobs
• Endpoint Controller → manages Service endpoints
Scheduler (kube-scheduler)	  Watches for Pods without assigned nodes. Chooses the best node for each Pod based on resources, affinity/anti-affinity, taints, tolerations, and policies.


2️⃣ Node Components (Worker Nodes)

These run Pods and containers.

Component	Purpose
Kubelet	Agent running on every node. Watches assigned Pods, ensures containers are running, manages volumes and networking, reports Pod status to the API server.
Container Runtime (containerd, Docker, CRI-O)	Actually pulls images and runs containers in Pods. Kubelet communicates with it via the CRI (Container Runtime Interface).
kube-proxy	Manages networking for Services. Implements ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, and routing rules to ensure traffic reaches the right Pods.
CNI plugin (Calico, Flannel, Weave, etc.)	Provides Pod networking: assigns Pod IPs, sets up routing between Pods, and enables cross-node communication.




1. Scalars (single values)
Scalars are plain values: string, number, boolean, null.

Example:
name: my-pod      # string scalar
replicas: 2       # integer scalar
enabled: true     # boolean scalar
description: null # null scalar

2. Maps (dictionaries / key-value pairs)
A map is a collection of key–value pairs.

Example:
metadata:                # map
  name: my-deployment    # scalar inside map
  labels:                # map inside map
    app: nginxapp
    tier: frontend

Here:
metadata → map
labels → map inside metadata
name: my-deployment → scalar inside metadata

3. Lists (arrays / sequences)
A list is an ordered collection, written with dashes -.

Example:
containers:            # list
  - name: nginx        # map (first item of list)
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:             # list inside map
      - containerPort: 80   # map inside list
  - name: sidecar      # map (second item of list)
    image: httpd
    ports:
      - containerPort: 81


Here:
containers → list
Each item in the list (- name: nginx, - name: sidecar) → map
Inside each container, ports is again a list → each item is a map (containerPort: 80)

✅ So YAML = Scalars + Maps + Lists
They can nest inside each other.
